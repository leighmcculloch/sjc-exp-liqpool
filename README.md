# sjc-liqpool

This is an experiment in trying to write some form of rudimentary liquidity pool
/ automated market maker for the wasm runtime of [Stellar Jump Cannon].

Run the contract using [sjc v0.5.0].

All code in this repository is an experiment, incomplete, and not suitable for
use in any form.

[sjc v0.5.0]: https://github.com/leighmcculloch/sjc/releases/tag/0.5.0
